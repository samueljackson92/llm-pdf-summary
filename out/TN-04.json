    "summary": "Exascale targeted plasma modelling will require the efficient and accurate solution of systems of hyperbolic and corresponding elliptic problems, in the presence of highly anisotropic dynamics. The techniques used to solve such problems must scale with the computing power available and be robust enough to be portable to any emerging hardware.",
