    "summary": "This report focuses on the initial phase of work undertaken by the University of Exeter and Imperial College London to investigate challenges for generation of high-order meshes for the NEPTUNE project. The report assesses surface mesh quality attained during the high-order mesh generation process, with a particular focus on the maximum deflection angle of surface normal from the underlying CAD representation.",
