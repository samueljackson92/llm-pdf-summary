    "summary": "This report focuses on the initial phase of work undertaken by King\u2019s College London and Imperial College London to investigate challenges for generation of high-order meshes for the NEPTUNE project. It extends the two-dimensional high-order mesh generation process for producing meshes for the tokamak edge region, with a particular focus on anisotropic element clustering leveraging the r-adaptation method.",
