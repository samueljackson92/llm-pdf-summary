    "summary": "This report explores model collision operators for ion-ion collisions, focusing on a 1D2V model of a simple two species plasma consisting of a drift kinetic model of ions and Boltzmann electrons. The study considers a model Krook operator and the initial stages of implementing the full Fokker-Planck operator.",
