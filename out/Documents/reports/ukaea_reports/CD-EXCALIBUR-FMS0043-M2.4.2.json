    "summary": "This report describes work for ExCALIBUR project NEPTUNE at Milestone 2.4.2. It focuses on the uncertainty sources in major scientific codes and introduces Forward Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) as a solution to capture epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. The report provides recommendations for UQ methodologies, particularly non-intrusive and semi-intrusive methods for NEPTUNE.",
