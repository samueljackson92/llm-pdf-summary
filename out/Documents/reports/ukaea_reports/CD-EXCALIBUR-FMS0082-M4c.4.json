    "summary": "This report describes progress made towards the implementation of a 3-D turbulence code tightly coupled to kinetic neutrals. The work includes the ParticleLoop implementation in NESO-Particles, the parallel dynamics of the Hasegawa-Wakatani model, and the recombination reaction kernel for neutral particles.",
