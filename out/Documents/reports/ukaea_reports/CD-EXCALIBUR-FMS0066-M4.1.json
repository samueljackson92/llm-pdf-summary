    "summary": "This report describes work done for the ExCALIBUR project NEPTUNE at Milestone M4.1. It collates technical material to prepare a call for high-dimensional procurement, including a description of a simple 1d1vkinetic solver implemented within the Nektar++ spectral / hpelement framework and its application to the textbook problem of the two-stream instability.",
