    "summary": "This report describes work for ExCALIBUR project NEPTUNE at Milestone M4.3, focusing on a 2-D model of neutral gas and impurities. It discusses inter-species interactions in the SOL, an extension to a particle implementation for global communication, and results from 2-D experiments with Particle-in-Cell algorithms.",
