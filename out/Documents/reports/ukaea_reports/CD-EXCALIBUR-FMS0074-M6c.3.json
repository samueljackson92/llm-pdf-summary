    "summary": "This report describes work for the ExCALIBUR project NEPTUNE at Milestone M6c.3. It focuses on the implementation of HERMES -3 equations in N EKTAR ++, improvements to the solver efficiency, and attempts to verify its outputs. The report also outlines further developments and verifies them against recent literature results.",
