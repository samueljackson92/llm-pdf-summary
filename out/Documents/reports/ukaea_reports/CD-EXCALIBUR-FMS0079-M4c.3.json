    "summary": "This report describes the development of an integrated particle and continuum model in 3d3v for the ExCALIBUR project NEPTUNE. The model represents plasma as a fluid using Nektar++ and populates the 3-D 3-V phase space with neutral particles via the SYCL-enabled NESO-Particles library.",
