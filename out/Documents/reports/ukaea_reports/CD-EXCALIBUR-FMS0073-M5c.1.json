    "summary": "This report outlines work on uncertainty quantification (UQ) and reduced-order modelling for the ExCALIBUR project NEPTUNE. The report includes a simple reduced-order model describing convective heat transfer coupled to diffusion, with a focus on one-way and two-way coupling, two-dimensional heat transfer, and the calculation of a stability boundary between steady and time-dependent solutions.",
