    "summary": "This document outlines the development and testing of 1D fluid models for plasma edge research as part of Project NEPTUNE. The work includes the use of SD1D, Hermes-3, and other tools to test individual parts of the model, explore uncertainty quantification, and develop sheath boundary conditions, multi-species coupling, and more.",
