    "summary": "This document describes a low-noise moment based method using the minepoch proxyapp for performance testing. It includes details about the implicit timestepping, Maxwell's equations, Eulerian mesh, extensions to allow drift-kinetic particles, and investigations into conserving charge (Gauss Law) and sub-stepping.",
