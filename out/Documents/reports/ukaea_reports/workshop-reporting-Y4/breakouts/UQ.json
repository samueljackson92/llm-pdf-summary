    "summary": "This document provides an overview of the slot convection problem and discusses the use of UCL tools for uncertainty quantification. The discussion covers parameter sweep for 2D problems, the minimum number of runs required, the approach to finding regimes in Nektar simulations, potential sources of differences between Smallab and Nektar, and considerations in constructing surrogates.",
