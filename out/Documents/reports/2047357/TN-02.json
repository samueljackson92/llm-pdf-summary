    "summary": "This report describes a numerical study on the solution of drift kinetic equations in plasma edge, focusing on developing and testing a novel analytical model for treating electron motion along magnetic field. The authors present a simple model for parallel plasma dynamics, their corresponding code, and compare numerical results with an analytical benchmark.",
