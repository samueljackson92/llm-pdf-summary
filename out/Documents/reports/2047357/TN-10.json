    "summary": "This report presents a set of drift kinetic models as candidate models for describing plasma dynamics parallel to the field in both open-field-line and closed-field-line regions of the edge, in the presence of neutrals. The aim is to test the relative e\ufb03cacy of these models for numerical simulation.",
