    "summary": "The present report draws a concise review of uncertainty quantificat ion methods classified according to their intrusiveness. Attentions is paid to non -intrusive and later semi -intrusive methods which enable to define procedures which are independent of the models equations, thus enabling full separation of concern. The rep ort also presents up-to-date toolkits, libraries and pieces of software that enable the high -throughput ensemble -based computations required for verification, validation and uncertainty quantification.",
