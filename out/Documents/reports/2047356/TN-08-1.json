    "summary": "In this report, we summarize experience gained in the application of non-intrusive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to a sample test case from the SD1D test cases set out in task 83-2.1. This provides a test ground for the practical aspects of UQ for realistic plasma simulations and showcases the easyvvuq package to facilitate the construction of UQ workflows.",
