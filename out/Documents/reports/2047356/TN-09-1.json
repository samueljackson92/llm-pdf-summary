    "summary": "Outlines test cases for a 1D multispecies plasma model given by system 2-5 of reference [1]. The tests build on the tests for the single plasma fluid model and cover three broad areas: separate ion and electron temperatures, enhanced neutral gas models including different excited states of hydrogen, and impurity species.",
