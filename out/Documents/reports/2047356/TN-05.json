    "summary": "This report explores the use of BOUT++ as a platform to test design patterns that enable plasma simulations models to be extended from single ion species to multiple species. The aim is to evaluate code designs, explore Domain Speci\ufb01c Languages (DSLs) for specifying complex multi-\ufb02uid models, and provide a platform for further development.",
