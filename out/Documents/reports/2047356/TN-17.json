    "summary": "This report briefly outlines the initial efforts on implementing the system 2-6 equation set within the Nektar++ framework. It discusses changes made to the equation set since the previous deliverable, and outlines a prototype solver for a simplified set of equations, as well as the future development pathway for system 2-6.",
