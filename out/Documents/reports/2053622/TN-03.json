    "summary": "This report focuses on the initial phase of work undertaken by King\u2019s College London and Imperial College London to investigate challenges for generation of high-order meshes for the NEPTUNE project. In this third report that comprises Deliverable 1.2 of our workplan, we extend the two-dimensional high-order mesh generation process for producing meshes for the tokamak edge region to contain quadrilateral elements.",
