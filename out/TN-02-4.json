    "summary": "This report outlines the current single-node performance of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) operators within Nektar++ on x86-64 CPU hardware platforms, with the aim of identifying present bottlenecks in the development of higher-dimensional DG kernels. The focus is on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.",
